Minimal setup that is needed to run Haskell binaries build with GHC-7.8 on
ubuntu trustyt.

It's not really minimal and not all binaries are supported.  I add more
dependencies as needed.

The image includes a busybox for debugging pruposes.

The image includes `strace`. That is useful to figure out what libraries are
missing in case binary doesn't run. In order to use `strace` the container must
be run with `--privileged=true`.
